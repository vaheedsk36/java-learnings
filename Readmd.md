## Java Notes

- We need JDK for developing java applications
- Every machine have jvm responsible for running java code
- jvm do not understand, java code it only can understand byte code (non human readable format)
- Using Javac i.e java compiler we convert java code to byte code
- Byte code is processed by jvm
- When working with the java we will use certain packages and to run it, we would require JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- So, jdk => jre => jvm (setup for development)
- Java applications, at times are said to be WORA (work once run anywhere)
- Any machine having jvm support can run java programs
- The user machine, need not require to have JDK, but it must have JRE and JVM in it
